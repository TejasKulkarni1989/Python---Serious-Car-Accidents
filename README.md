# Python---Serious-Car-Accidents
Serious Car Accidents Prediction
This is an Imbalanced dataset with only 11 cases of Serious Car Accidents and rest Not Serious Accidents the predictions were coming to be really bad so instead of using SMOTE to balance the data I plotted the Roc curve ( TPR - FPR curve) and changed the default threshold to somewhere we are getting better precision and recall scores and then selected the best model with its best threshold to make its final prediction. I got a **Prefect Score** in the JSOM **Applied Machine Learning** competition / Final exam.
